# Design Goals 

* Consistent presentation 
  (all triangles are (0,0)-based, no fiddling with offsets).

* Consistent representations
  (by uniform use of the ``TablGenerator``).

* Implementations uniformly based on rows, not on terms.

* High performance. 

* No use of external libraries. 

* A simple swiss-knife user interface.

* Guides the user through the tabl jungle in the ``oeis`` to the most useful and intriguing integer triangles.
